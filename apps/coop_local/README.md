## About

The project is mainly a hobby project of myself. I have started it to evaluate a good way for an application architecture with `Slint` and `Rust`.
Now I'm on to create a file browser that fits my personal needs and taste. So it will be including extra features like. a game launcher, music player and image viewer.
Also if there are some features implemented now the project is still in early stage. As mentioned it's mainly a personal project but if someone else is interested in `coop_local` you can check further topics and progress on https://codeberg.org/flovansl/co_sl/issues/33.
